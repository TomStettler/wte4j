# wte4j - word template engine for java

## What is wte4j?
The wte4j is a Spring component that generates Open XML documents from a template.
As a template one can use .docx or .dotx files with content-controls used by Microsoft Word as placeholders for the dynamic content.

## What do you get?
The wte4j consists of three modules:

- **wte4j-core** is the template engine, usable as a Spring component
- **wte4j-admin** is a web app for managing the templates in a repository of a wte4j instance
- **wte4j-demo** is a small demo web app that uses the wte-core and wte-admin to give a functional overview of wte4j

## How to run the wte4j-demo?
