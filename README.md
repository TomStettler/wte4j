# word template engine for java - wte4j

## What is wte4j?
The wte4j is a Spring-component to generate Open XML documents from a template.
As a template one can use .docx or .dotx files with content-controls used by Microsoft Word as placeholders for the dynamic content.

## What do you get?
The wte4j consists of three modules:

- The **wte4j-core** module is a Spring-component and is the template engine
- The **wte4j-admin** module is a webApp for managing the template in a repository of a specific wte4j-instance
- The **wte4j-demo** module is a small demo webApp basend on the wte-core and wte-admin to give a functional overview of wte4j

## How to run the wte4j-demo?
